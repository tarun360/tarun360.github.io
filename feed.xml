I checked its origin and found that it’s a parent adage implying that children grow up fast. But for me it somehow reminded me of my daily life as a software engineer. The days are long – meetings, debugging, some coding, and some more debugging. That stupid bug takes forever to fix, seemingly the most important thing in my life at the moment, but a week later I can’t even remember what it was.</p>

<p>Few months later, on re-reading the book <i>Man’s Search For Meaning</i> by Victor E. Frankl, I was drawn upon the idea of “provisional existence” – A man who is not able to see the end of his “provisional existence” ceases to have an ultimate aim in his life. The book mentions how Frankl’s fellow inmates in Germany’s concentration camps, having no idea when their liberation would happen, found their days longer than weeks. The book gives additional examples of how tuberculosis patients in a sanatorium having no fixed date of their release felt a similar phenomenon. I could relate this to my profession of software engineering at big tech companies. The daily tasks seem arduous and long, but the week goes by rather swiftly.</p>

<p>The entire promotion cycle within these big tech companies feels like a gamified and self-fulfilling endeavour. Moving from one level to another takes increasingly longer periods: approximately 1.5 years from L1 to L2, around 3 years from L2 to L3, then jumps of roughly 4 years, 6 years, and so on.The career growth is logarithmic; worse than linear. Stock options are structured in a way that there’s disproportionately more money in unvested stocks, incentivizing employees to stay longer; exemplifying the principle of loss aversion. Everything Is designed to keep individuals on the hedonic treadmill, with no discernible end date — just a perpetual cycle.</p>

<p>To be sure, software engineering is one of the cushiest jobs available right now in India, and I believe elsewhere as well. It offers excellent pay and favourable working conditions. The problem seems to me, as Victor Frankl puts it, means to live but no meaning. <a href="https://www.jointaro.com/question/PeIMgVaRQj8sToE44qqr/i-feel-destined-for-mediocrity-is-there-a-way-out/">This post</a> by a senior software engineer at Pinterest seems to be a common phenomenon. This is something which I actively notice in myself and my colleagues as well. People consciously or unconsciously try to combat it in different ways.</p>

<p>Some choose to slog longer hours in pursuit of additional responsibilities, finding meaning in mentoring or managing new employees. Others seek solace in luxurious experiences, dining at expensive restaurants or embarking on foreign vacations to Europe. Some distract themselves with video games like DOTA or CSGO. Then there are those who opt to switch careers, with product management being a popular choice, or venture into entrepreneurship.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="personal" /><category term="psych" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Insights after working as a software engineer for 1 year.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Second blog</title><link href="https://tarun360.github.io/blog/2023/second-blog/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Second blog" /><published>2023-04-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-04-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://tarun360.github.io/blog/2023/second-blog</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://tarun360.github.io/blog/2023/second-blog/"><![CDATA[<p>Second blog</p>
