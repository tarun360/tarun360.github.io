ABSTRACT={Macromolecular structure classification from cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) data is important for understanding macro-molecular dynamics. It has a wide range of applications and is essential in enhancing our knowledge of the sub-cellular environment. However, a major limitation has been insufficient labelled cryo-ET data. In this work, we use Contrastive Self-supervised Learning (CSSL) to improve the previous approaches for macromolecular structure classification from cryo-ET data with limited labels. We first pretrain an encoder with unlabelled data using CSSL and then fine-tune the pretrained weights on the downstream classification task. To this end, we design a cryo-ET domain-specific data-augmentation pipeline. The benefit of augmenting cryo-ET datasets is most prominent when the original dataset is limited in size. Overall, extensive experiments performed on real and simulated cryo-ET data in the semi-supervised learning setting demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in macromolecular labeling and classification.}

abstract = {Twin Support Vector Clustering (TWSVC) is a clustering algorithm inspired by the principles of Twin Support Vector Machine (TWSVM). TWSVC has already outperformed other traditional plane based clustering algorithms. However, TWSVC uses hinge loss, which maximizes shortest distance between clusters and hence suffers from noise-sensitivity and low re-sampling stability. In this article, we propose Pinball loss Twin Support Vector Clustering (pinTSVC) as a clustering algorithm. The proposed pinTSVC model incorporates the pinball loss function in the plane clustering formulation. Pinball loss function introduces favorable properties such as noise-insensitivity and re-sampling stability. The time complexity of the proposed pinTSVC remains equivalent to that of TWSVC. Extensive numerical experiments on noise-corrupted benchmark UCI and artificial datasets have been provided. Results of the proposed pinTSVC model are compared with TWSVC, Twin Bounded Support Vector Clustering (TBSVC) and Fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM). Detailed and exhaustive comparisons demonstrate the better performance and generalization of the proposed pinTSVC for noise-corrupted datasets. Further experiments and analysis on the performance of the above-mentioned clustering algorithms on structural MRI (sMRI) images taken from the ADNI database, face clustering, and facial expression clustering have been done to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed pinTSVC model.},
