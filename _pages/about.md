As a software engineer at [D. E. Shaw India](https://www.deshawindia.com/). I'm currently working on developing a high-performance cluster (HPC) scheduling software for the cloud, with a specific focus on orchestrating machine learning tasks, such as model training.

I graduated from Computer Science and Engineering department at Indian Institute of Technology Indore. I had the oppurtunity to collaborate with world-class laboratories around the world in the field machine learning - [Xu lab@CBD_SCS_CMU](https://xulabs.github.io/), [Speech and Language laboratory - NTU](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/aseschng/speechLab_intro.html), [Skit.ai](skit.ai), [OPTIMAL lab - IIT Indore](https://iiti.ac.in/people/~mtanveer/).

(Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
