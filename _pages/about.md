### Hi there!

Thanks for visiting my website. My name is Tarun. Please take a look around.

Current favourite quote: <i>"I believe that it would be worth trying to learn something about the world even if in trying to do so we should merely learn that we do not know much ... It might be well for all of us to remember that, while differing widely in the various little bits we know, in our infinite ignorance we are all equal."</i> â€• Karl Popper in his book Conjectures and Refutations (1963)

(Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
