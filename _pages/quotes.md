- <i>"I think that there is only one way to science - or to philosophy, for that matter: to meet a problem, to see its beauty and fall in love with it; to get married to it and to live with it happily, till death do ye part - unless you should meet another and even more fascinating problem or unless, indeed, you should obtain a solution. But even if you do obtain a solution, you may then discover, to your delight, the existence of a whole family of enchanting, though perhaps difficult, problem children, for whose welfare you may work, with a purpose, to the end of your days."</i> ― Karl Popper

- <i>"I believe that it would be worth trying to learn something about the world even if in trying to do so we should merely learn that we do not know much ...

- <i>"The mind is sharper and keener in seclusion and uninterrupted solitude. No big laboratory is needed in which to think.
