- <i>“In each shave lies a philosophy.”</i> ― Somerset Maugham

- <i>“To ask the right question is harder than to answer it.”</i> ― Georg Cantor

- <i>“The days are long, but the years are short.”</i> ― Gretchen Rubin

- <i>"The secret to doing good research[/work] is always to be a little underemployed. You waste years by not being able to waste hours.”</i> ― Amos Tversky

- <i>"Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better."</i> ― Samuel Beckett <i>(The real motto of optimism)</i>

- <i>"Dance first. Think later. It's the natural order" ― Samuel Beckett</i>

- <i>“It follows that humans, people and knowledge are not only objectively significant: they are by far the most significant phenomena in nature – the only ones whose behaviour cannot be understood without understanding everything of fundamental importance.”</i> ― David Deutsch in his book The Beginning of Infinity

- <i>"I think that there is only one way to science - or to philosophy, for that matter: to meet a problem, to see its beauty and fall in love with it; to get married to it and to live with it happily, till death do ye part - unless you should meet another and even more fascinating problem or unless, indeed, you should obtain a solution. But even if you do obtain a solution, you may then discover, to your delight, the existence of a whole family of enchanting, though perhaps difficult, problem children, for whose welfare you may work, with a purpose, to the end of your days."</i> ― Karl Popper

- <i>"I believe that it would be worth trying to learn something about the world even if in trying to do so we should merely learn that we do not know much ... It might be well for all of us to remember that, while differing widely in the various little bits we know, in our infinite ignorance we are all equal."</i> ― Karl Popper in his book Conjectures and Refutations (1963) 

- <i>"The mind is sharper and keener in seclusion and uninterrupted solitude. No big laboratory is needed in which to think. Originality thrives in seclusion free of outside influences beating upon us to cripple the creative mind. Be alone, that is the secret of invention; be alone, that is when ideas are born."</i> ― Nikola Tesla

- <i>"From outside, if you have dispaired of getting into it [the inner ring], you call it “That gang” or “they” or “So-and-so and his set” or “The Caucus” or “The Inner Ring.” If you are a candidate for admission you probably don’t call it anything. To discuss it with the other outsiders would make you feel outside yourself. And to mention talking to the man who is inside, and who may help you if this present conversation goes well, would be madness."</i> ― C.S. Lewis in his essay "The Inner Ring"

- <i>"We are told in Scripture that those who ask get. That is true, in senses I can’t now explore. But in another sense there is much truth in the schoolboy’s principle “them as asks shan’t have.” To a young person, just entering on adult life, the world seems full of “insides,” full of delightful intimacies and confidentialities, and he desires to enter them. But if he follows that desire he will reach no “inside” that is worth reaching. The true road lies in quite another direction. It is like the house in Alice Through the Looking Glass."</i> ― C.S. Lewis in his essay "The Inner Ring"

- <i>"No man who cares about originality will ever be original. It's the man who's only thinking about doing a good job or telling the truth who becomes really original -- and doesn't notice it."</i> ― C.S. Lewis

- <i>"It is important that students bring a certain ragamuffin, barefoot, irreverence to their studies; they are not here to worship what is known, but to question it."</i> ― Jacob Bronowski in The Ascent of Man

- <i>"You cannot get educated by this self-propagating system in which people study to pass exams, and teach others to pass exams, but nobody knows anything. You learn something by doing it yourself, by asking questions, by thinking, and by experimenting."</i> — Richard P. Feynman.

- <i>"The most important thing in life is to be free"</i> — Sourav Chatterjee in [this](https://youtu.be/YpaytTN1EgA?si=FabIFxAN0mzqfLbr) video.

- <i>"If you are so smart, then why aren't you happy?"</i> — Raj Raghunathan / Naval Ravikant.
