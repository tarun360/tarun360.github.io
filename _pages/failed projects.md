I somehow feel like some of my failed/incomplete projects are maybe more interesting than the ones that actually worked out. So, this is a page to record them since I am not sure how to squeeze them into a regular ol' resume.

#### Real-time capabilities of Android OS

We executed multi-threaded C code on our personal Android mobile phones (courtesy pandemic) to collect statistics like interrupt latency and semaphore shuffling time. This was aimed at assessing the real-time performance of Android 11. We concluded that assessing metrics solely through software will not be accurate enough. Hardware instrumentation was deemed necessary for a accurate evaluation, but unfortunately, we lacked access to it (courtesy pandemic). This project stood out as one of the rare projects without any curation: no curated datasets or a final "state-of-the-art" benchmark to surpass — just pure happy hacking/researching.

#### Vital signs monitoring from video

Our aim was to estimate essential vital signs like pulse rate and respiration rate using videos captured in non-medical settings, like from smartphones. We soon recognized the lack of a suitable (and free) dataset meeting our precise requirements. In response, we embarked on the seemingly impossible task — recording videos of our college friends for a minute, urging them not to laugh. Needless to say, it didn't go smoothly; we managed to gather just about 5 or so recordings. But it was certainly an enjoyable and amusing experience.
