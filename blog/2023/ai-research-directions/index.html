  <article class="post-content">
    <p>This blog is inspired by the question posed by Dr. Richard Hamming in his famous “You and Your Research” talk: “If what you are working on is not important, and it’s not likely to lead to important things, then why are you working on it?”</p>

<p>I have two specific directions in mind that I believe can lead to significant <i>things</i> in the field of AI (excluding applications in fields like medicine and biology): the first involves constructing a virtual playground for embodied multi-agent collaboration that can co-evolve into more intelligent agents, and the second focuses on building AI models that emulate the neural structures of the brain. I will briefly describe these two ideas below.</p>

<p><strong>Constructing a virtual playground for embodied multi-agent collaboration</strong></p>

<p>Exciting advancements have been made in constructing virtual playgrounds to investigate single-agent exploration [1] and multi-agent collaboration [2, 3]. The latter, as per my exploration, is less widely studied than the former. It is the latter that I believe holds more potential. These environments typically feature a leader agent and a follower agent working together to solve tasks. Leader-follower interactions can occur through various methods. For instance, the leader might issue instructions for a task, such as selecting a specific card from a set of distractor cards in the virtual environment, as in [2]. Subsequently, the follower is tasked with completing the assigned objective. Dialogue may transpire between the leader’s instructions and the follower’s actions. Notably, these instructions are typically communicated in a natural language, say English. These virtual environments are valuable for studying natural language interactions within collaborative and embodied environments.</p>

<p><i>I have an intuition, a vague idea, which I believe could advance the research on embodied multi-agent collaboration</i>, drawing inspiration from [2, 4, 5], and, to the best of my knowledge, unexplored thus far: Construct a virtual environment featuring a leader and a follower. The follower’s role is to observe the leader executing a task and intelligently imitate them. For instance, if the leader hides behind a tree to evade a lion, the follower should seek shelter behind an available object, like a large stone nearest to it, to avoid the lion. Blindly copying the leader, such as traveling to the leader’s position and attempting to hide behind the same small tree, could harm both.</p>

<p>Initially, the follower may adopt an approach akin to behavior parsing [6], employing a mechanistic imitation model, similar to ape behavior, based on statistical correlation without a deep understanding of the leader’s motives. However, as tasks become more difficult, there would be evolutionary pressure for the follower to develop a nuanced understanding of why a leader performs a specific task and determine the appropriate imitation variant, i.e., not copying the behavior blindly but copying the meaning of the behavior, i.e., the meme [5]. This necessitates creativity and the formulation of explanatory theories by the follower [4].</p>

<p>It would be advantageous for the follower to infer the leader’s mental state [7] (Theory of Mind) and generate explanatory theories about the reasons behind the leader’s actions and the contexts in which the follower should imitate them. Furthermore, in this virtual environment, communication between the leader and follower could be facilitated through some communication channel, such as exchanging arrays of bits. Since communication between the leader and follower would be helpful for the follower to understand the meme, it’s conceivable to imagine this array of bits transforming into a rudimentary sign language (emergent communication [8]).</p>

<p>This is just an intuitive direction that I think may lead to important discoveries. There is much to be figured out here; for example, the most difficult aspect would be how to design tasks which the leader agent is supposed to do, and the joint training of the leader and follower agent model. Perhaps, as a starting point one can consider crowdsourcing to generate the leader tasks, similar to [2], and then try to intelligently combine these tasks to generate more of them. Additionally, one would need to greatly improve the Theory of Mind idea so the follower can learn to model the leader’s worldview effectively. Lastly, constructing such a virtual environment would necessitate proficient game and software development skills.</p>

<p><strong>Building AI models that mimic the neural structures of the brain</strong></p>

<p>The present state of constructing increasingly complex machine learning architectures appears futile in creating a genuinely intelligent AI, or AGI. Merely combining different modalities blindly, such as outfitting a robot with vision, auditory, and text-understanding models, will not magically transform it into an intelligent agent. As articulated by Deutsch in [9], “Expecting to create an AGI without first understanding in detail how it works is like expecting skyscrapers to learn to fly if we build them tall enough.”</p>

<p>A more promising approach with a higher potential for AGI development would be to construct models inspired by the neural structures and geometries of the brain. Given that the brain inherently serves as an AGI, and with techniques such as fMRI, BOLD, and searchlight providing avenues for studying its internal structure, it is logical to examine the brain’s activity during diverse tasks. Subsequently, building AI models to replicate the observed neuronal structures during these tasks is a worthwhile strategy.</p>

<p>A noteworthy paper in this context is “Neural Knowledge Assembly in Humans and Neural Networks” [10]. This paper intrigued me due to the authors’ clever approach to testing a hypothesis (the elongation scheme) on rapid knowledge assembly in the human brain through a creative decision-making task performed by human participants. They monitored their brains’ dorsal stream structures using BOLD and searchlight techniques. Subsequently, the authors made a strikingly simple and elegant addition to a modest 2-layer neural network (a certainty matrix) to mimic the elongation scheme observed in human brains. In the current landscape of machine learning research, which often leans towards larger models, empirical fine-tuning, and explanation-less progress, it was invigorating to encounter a fundamental enhancement to a simple 2-layer neural network model inspired by knowledge assembly processes within the human brain.</p>

<p>Some other works include how speech aspects like context [11] and phonemes [12] impact neural structural representation. Understanding the representation structure of language in the human brain could aid in designing NLP models that emulate these structures, potentially resulting in improved NLP models similar to the approach taken in [10]. Overall, this fundamental research approach, where advancements in basic machine learning models are inspired by brain processes driven by conjecture and explanatory theories rather than solely increasing model complexity, is a worthwhile direction in pursuit of building better AI models.</p>
