The 'You and Your Research' talk by Dr. Richard Hamming is a fantastic discussion applicable to careers in any field. One can watch it on YouTube <a href="https://youtu.be/a1zDuOPkMSw?si=K07WoHnMhQ8Nm1fR">here</a>. Dr. Hamming imparts great advice on envisioning your research or career and leading a purposeful life. Here I would like to share my thoughts on two specific ideas mentioned in this talk:

<i>"If what you are working on is not important, and it's not likely to lead to important things, then why are you working on it?"</i>

This statement, and similar ideas about 'meaningful work', always make me ponder — what work should I really do? I certainly admit that my current software engineering job doesn't quite measure up to the level of 'meaningful work' like drug discovery or rocket building. However, I console myself with the belief that I am building useful skills, preparing for a future where I can engage in work with tangible societal impact, rather than just making some enterprise messaging tool 10% faster. I have engaged in research during my undergrad, and while I am super proud of the work I have done, it's certainly not in the top 1% category, far from it. Lately, I have been striving to make more meaningful contributions. For instance, I recently read a compelling paper about changing the incentive structure of social media platforms to combat fake news. The paper provided very practical, gamified solutions. After reading it, I had some ideas on how to extend it, and I emailed the authors with my thoughts. Well, that's something. After all, ideas have infinite reach.

<i>"Study your successes closely"</i>

We often hear about learning from failures, but this was probably the first time I contemplated learning from successes. I recently experienced a kind of success, if one could call it that. I had spent 3-4 months tirelessly trying to secure a collaboration opportunity with an early-stage AI startup — countless hours (and headaches due to screen brightness) spent scraping sites like Y Combinator and LinkedIn to connect with early-stage AI startups. Didn't get any success and eventually left it. A month after giving it a rest, a startup co-founder reached out to me with the opportunity I was seeking. It was quite serendipitous. This happened because during my previous search, I had interacted with a post on AI startups, and this co-founder found my profile through that interaction. It's remarkable how, by reaching out and creating some entropy, one can potentially create luck for oneself. This was one of the motivations for sending the email mentioned above. Although waiting to get struck by lightning isn't the best approach, so I am also pursuing something more specific on the side.
