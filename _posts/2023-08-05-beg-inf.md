On July 19th, 2023, a firm-wide town hall took place at D. E. Shaw’s India office, where I am currently employed as a software engineer. The event aimed to enable senior leadership from the NYC and Hyderabad offices to discuss the firm's future objectives, challenges, and strategies. A standout moment occurred when an unexpected response from a managing director, “We may run out of ideas,” highlighted a major risk, stressing the need for ongoing creative trading strategies, as older methods lose efficacy over time.

Is it possible to continuously improve trading strategies and continue to generate profits indefinitely? There is a somewhat reasonable argument suggesting that all trading strategies employed by various firms would strive for maximum efficiency, leading to a potential state of equilibrium where further optimization becomes unlikely. In this hypothetical scenario, all trading strategies across firms would reach an equilibrium, efficient state, making further improvement seemingly impossible.

David Deutch's thought-provoking book, "Beginning of Infinity," presents a compelling argument favouring infinite progress, from which one could infer the continuous improvement of trading algorithms. The book asserts that as long as error correction mechanisms are integrated into a system (as is inherent in trading markets), the system can infinitely self-improve. It posits that anything allowed by the physical laws of nature can be achieved through the continual generation of knowledge and error-correcting mechanisms.

The full depth of this concept of infinite progress is not easily condensed. Therefore, I highly recommend delving into the pages of "Beginning of Infinity." The book's title, "Beginning of Infinity," takes an interesting perspective: Within an infinite set of whole numbers, any number you select (e.g., 10<sup>82</sup> &asymp; the number of atoms in the universe) will always be <i>unusually</i> close to 0 (i.e., the beginning). Hence, in the grand scheme of infinity, we are always at the beginning – beginning of infinity – always.
